# iRoom
A more intuitive Videochat solution using WebRTC

iRoom is a Videochat software solution that works more intuitively:

Users are in a Room together and they can move theyr own video feed around. 
If they drag it towards someone else's video feed the other video feed grows bigger and the volume increases.
This provides a more realistic experience of a gathering of bigger groups  because normally you only want top talk to one person instead of holding a lecture to the whole group, whit iRoom you can have both at the same time:
You can alwyas see the whole group on your screen and quickly move towards one group if your name is mentioned ;) 
You can move freely on your screen and because the volume changes in real time this would also be ideal for blind people who can navigate by just listening if the volume of the different people goes up or down.

It is our goal to make this project as accessible as possible by also using the arrow keys to move your video around. This way we can make sure all people can use it and nobody is left behind especially in this current crisis.

You are very welcome to contribute especially if you are familiar with WebRTC as I'm only just starting out on that topic.
But if you are just looking for a fun project and just fiddeling around with the frontend, you are very welcome as well. ;)
